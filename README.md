A beautiful and user-friendly interface to run Ollama's models locally, with an option to expose the local model to the internet for broader accessibility. This project aims to make it as easy as possible to get started with large language models (LLMs) without tedious setup!

## Getting Started üöÄ

To use the web interface, these requisites must be met:

1. Download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and have it running. Or run it in a Docker container. Check the [docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) for instructions.
2. Node.js (18+) and npm is required. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)


### You can use Ollama Web UI in two ways:

### 1. Using the Website

- Use a MongoDB Atlas URL to store chats and other data.
- The MongoDB URL format should be: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net` (Ensure access is permitted to all IPs: `0.0.0.0/0`).
- Open [ollama-web-ui.vercel.app](https://ollama-web-ui.vercel.app).
- Expose your local Ollama model to the internet (use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for this) and paste that URL in the `OLLAMA_HOST` field on the website.

### 2. Running Locally (Recommended).

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syed-iqbal-Ahammad/ollama-web-ui.git
   cd ollama-web-ui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
